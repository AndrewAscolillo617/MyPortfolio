          <p>About Me</p>
          <p>I’m a full-stack developer with a sharp focus on architectural clarity and system design. 
            My academic foundation and hands-on experience have shaped a methodical, 
            principle-driven approach to building scalable, maintainable software.</p>

          <p>I’ve worked with Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Heroku, PostgreSQL, 
            and more — always pushing for clean logic and purposeful design. I approach development with discipline 
            and curiosity, constantly refining my skills and aligning with best practices.</p>
          <p>I’m actively seeking a full-time role where I can grow as a teammate and deliver high-impact code.</p>
          <p>I’m driven to master full-stack development end-to-end — from initial concept and layout architecture 
            to deployment and optimization. I believe in understanding every layer of the stack, not just using it.</p>
          <p>I’m excited to contribute to a company that values clarity, intent, and technical excellence as much as I do.</p>
