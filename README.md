# My Portfolio

A simple portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It’s designed to be modular and transparent, and also serves as part of my learning process. I’m using this project to get more comfortable with the stack while building something real.

## Tech Stack

- Next.JS
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Formspree (contact form)

## Features

- Darkmode/Lightmode theme toggle
- Contact form
- Responsive Layout
- Accessible and SEO-friendly

## Design Philosophy

This project is both a functional portfolio and a learning exercise. The code is intentionally minimal, maintainable, and adaptable, with the goal of evolving and refactoring over time. Every component is modular, and every interaction is purposeful.
